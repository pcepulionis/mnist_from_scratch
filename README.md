Hey! PyData meetup will be held this week!

Here is the information you need!

First of all, the interest of the event is quite huge. We want to warn you that there is a shortage of seating or tables, so don't be afraid if you need to stand or sit on the ground. Also, try to recharge your computer batteries (if you are going to use it), because we will really run out of power extensions!

Secondly, we have prepared for you an exemplary Jupyter script that will download data to your computer from tensorflow and make sure that everything is working! https://github.com/pcepulionis/mnist_from_scratch

We also want to remind you that we will speak technically, so we hope you have heard about the multiplication of matrices!

Please, RSVP by clicking the "YES" or "NO" buttons in meetup event.

You can download Jupyter with Python from here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ or you can use a Google Colab instead: https://colab.research.google.com/
